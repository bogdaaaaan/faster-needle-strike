# Faster Needle Charge

## Description
This mod reduces Hornet’s Needle Strike charge time, making charged attacks faster, smoother, and easier to integrate into combat.

- Default charge: **1.35s → 0.8s (~40% faster)**
- With Quick Charge equipped: **0.8s → 0.4s (~50% faster)**

The goal is to make Needle Strike a viable tool for combos and dynamic playstyles, instead of something players avoid because of its long wind-up.

## Installation
1. Make sure you have **BepInEx** installed in your Silksong directory.
2. Download the mod `.dll` file.
3. Place the `.dll` in your game folder under:

## Compatibility
- Compatible with most mods that don’t alter Needle Strike mechanics.
- If another mod edits the same values, load order may affect behavior.

---

2. The game will return to default behavior.
